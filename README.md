## 🎯 Usage

### Basic Implementation

The app follows a simple architecture pattern:

1. **Main Entry Point** (`main.dart`)
   ```dart
   void main() {
     runApp(MyApp());
   }
   ```

2. **E-commerce Screen** (`exomerce.dart`)
   - Fetches products from API
   - Displays in responsive grid
   - Handles loading and error states

3. **API Integration**
   ```dart
   // Fetch products from Fake Store API
   final response = await http.get(
     Uri.parse('https://fakestoreapi.com/products')
   );
   ```

### Customization

#### Modify API Endpoint
Update the API URL in `exomerce.dart`:
```dart
final String apiUrl = 'your-api-endpoint-here';
```

#### Customize UI Theme
Modify the theme in `main.dart`:
```dart
MaterialApp(
  theme: ThemeData(
    primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
    // Add your custom theme here
  ),
)
```
